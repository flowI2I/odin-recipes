I will be creating a website that contain a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
The website won't look pretty as first but when I do return to this, it will look much better.

7/30/2025 7:49pm I did up to the links of going back and forth with index and the receipes, I will return again to coding the next day.

7/31/2025 I have added the steps and photos to the two recipes. I had trouble remembering on how to resize the image. I went back few lessons to remember the steps. Thanks odin.
